Objective

In this challenge, we practice reading input from stdin and printing output to stdout.

In C++, you can read a single whitespace-separated token of input using cin, and print output to stdout using cout. For example, let's say we declare the following variables:

string s;
int n;


and we want to use cin to read the input "High 5" from stdin. We can do this with the following code:

Sample Input:
1 3 6
Sample Output

10
Explanation

The sum of the three numbers is 1+3+6=10 .







#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


int main() {
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */
       int a,b,c;
       cin>>a>>b>>c;
       int sum = a+b+c;
       cout << sum << endl;
    return 0;
}
